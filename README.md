# 3DComputer_Graphics_ALG
there are include 4 projects with computer graphics drawing or rendering algorithms.
# Introduction
 ## Proj1
Proj 1 is a simple program can use mouse to click on monitor, then draw 2D shapes, such as line, dot, circle , polygon. This proj only use OpenGL method, drawDot, to complete and implement midpoint draw line alg.


### Feature 

#### mode
the program contain `4` modes, include:
* `d` : the initial mode is mode d, and you can switch to this mode by keyboard input `d`. Under this mode user can draw `dot`. 
* `l` : User can switch to this mode by keyboard input `l`. Under this mode user can draw `line`.
* `p` : User can switch to this mode by keyboard input `p`. Under this mode user can draw `polygon`.
* `o` : User can switch to this mode by keyboard input `o`. Under this mode user can draw `circle`. 

#### how to draw
##### dot
left click the canvas, and the dot will be draw on the position mouse click.
##### line 
left click the canvas for two times, the dot will be draw on canvas from the position first click to the second one.
##### polygon 
left click the canvas for many times, the edge of polygon will be drawn. right click to complete the polygon drawing. 
##### circle 
left click the canvas, and the cirlce will be drawn for the center is position mouse down, and the radius is the position mouse up to position mouse down.

#### Other function
##### clear screen
 pressed keyboard `c` to use.
##### recovery 
 pressed keyboard `r` to use.
##### exit 
 pressed keyboard `q` to use.

## Porj2
proj 2 implement 2D line and polygon drawing, pattern transformation, View Port, Clipping and execute the commands, include `scale`, `rotate`, `translate`, `square`, `triangle`, `view`, `clearData`, `clearScreen`. It will read .asc file as input.
## Proj3
Proj 3 is implement 3D line and line and polygon drawing, pattern transformation, View Port, Clipping, hidden surface removal and execute the commands, include `scale`, `rotate`, `translate`, `object`, `observer`, `viewport`, `nobackfaces`, `reset`. It will read .asc file as input.
## Proj4
Proj 4 is implement 3D line and line and polygon drawing, pattern transformation, View Port, Clipping, hidden surface removal, lighting & shading, polygon filling and execute the commands, include `scale`, `rotate`, `translate`, `object`, `observer`, `viewport`, `nobackfaces`, `reset`. It will read .asc file as input.

# Usages
  *  install Visual Studio, and create new proj, and put data to `debug` folder, then run the code.
